# FirePanel
The code for our Fire Panel Project

There are three files in total for our project.

Fire Panel Source Code
The code here controls the panel's input and outputs, it interfaces with the sensors to show the information the sensors get on
the fire panel, it also allows the user to press buttons and do different functions on the fire panel.

Fire Sensor Source Code
This code reads the outputs from the sensors and outputs readable signals for the Fire Panel to interpret

LCD Source Code
This is a separate file to control the outputs of the LCD, it receives information from the Fire Panel Source Code and outputs
accordingly.
